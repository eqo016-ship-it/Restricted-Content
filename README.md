  <em>An advanced, highly optimized Telegram bot to download restricted media from private chats, featuring custom routing, batch filtering. Also added auto-forwarding support.</em>
</p>
<hr>

## ✨ Features

- **Media Extraction:** Download media from restricted chats.
- **Auto-Forwarding:** Auto-forward media bypassing the UI limit (100 messages).
- **Custom Caption:** Dynamically strip unwanted text from captions.
- **Custom Routing:** Option to route batch downloads directly to a target channel/group.
- **Media Filtering:** Grab specific media types during batch processes (e.g., only `video` or `doc`).

## 📋 Requirements

To begin using the bot, ensure you have the following:

- **Telegram Bot Token:** Get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- **API ID and Hash:** Create an application on [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) to get these.
  > **Warning**: This is an irreversible process; API ID and API Hash can only be deleted by deleting your Telegram account. Never share your credentials.
- **Session String:** Run `session-string.py` in your environment (e.g., Colab) and follow the prompts to generate your Pyrogram session string. This is used to login.
- **Bot Permissions:** When routing to a custom channel, ensure the bot is an Administrator with 'Post Messages' rights.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak the bot's performance by adjusting `config.py`:
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS`**: Number of simultaneous downloads (default: `1`)
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`**: Number of simultaneous uploads (default: `1`)
- **`BATCH_SIZE`**: Number of posts to process in parallel during batch downloads (default: `1`)
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSMISSIONS`**: Number of parallel connections per transfer (default: `2`). Keep in mind, higher is not always better.
- **`FLOOD_WAIT_DELAY`**: Delay in seconds between batch chunks to respect Telegram's API limits (default: `5`)
